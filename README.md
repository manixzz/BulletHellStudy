# Bullet Hell Study

This repository contains code used to create a bullet hell game that implements two different scaling types. We used this game during my time at G-ScalE to conduct experiments observing player performance with respect to screen configuration and scale type. More information about the study, and its results, can be found [here](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~teather/pdfs/GEM2014_poster1.pdf).
